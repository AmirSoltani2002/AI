# AI Final Project (Pacman)
Pac-Man is a classic arcade game where players control a yellow, circular character named Pac-Man in a maze-like pitch filled with walls and blue dots. The objective is to navigate the maze, eating all the blue dots while avoiding enemies. Pac-Man can move in four directions—up, down, left, or right—but must carefully plan his path to avoid getting trapped. As Pac-Man eats the blue dots, players earn points, and completing the maze progresses the game to more challenging levels. In this project, a simple version of the game is implemented in which the yellow pacman tries to eat all the blue points with minimum number of movements using the Q-learning algorithm. Run following code in the Pacman directory:
```bash
python3 Game.py
```
